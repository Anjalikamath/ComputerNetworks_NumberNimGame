# CN_NUMBER_NIM_GAME
Developed a 2 player Number-Nim game using Python web sockets and Tkinter (for GUI) as part of Computer Networks class at PES University, Bangalore, India.

A brief description of the Number-Nim game: <br>
The game involves groups containing odd number of objects. Each player takes turns to select objects and remove them from the group until there are no objects left.
Players can remove as many objects as they want in each turn. However, they can only remove objects from one group at each turn.
The player who takes out the last piece loses. 

This game has been programed into Python 3 using Tkinter for the GUI.
